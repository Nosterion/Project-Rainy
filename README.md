# Project-Rainy
A website for a visual novel in the making.
Content is still very barebone, will continue when I will have the time.
File sizes/loading speed is not optimized, will work on it later.

Finished the Gallery section. Now clicking on an image will change the style from photography to pencil drawing into oil painting.
Also added a button which changes the style of all pictures at once.

Made changes to the file structure.
