# Project-Rainy
A website for a visual novel in the making.
Content is still very barebone, will continue when I will have the time.
There are only the not transformed pictures in the gallery, but the painted versions are uploaded in the resources/img/pictures folder.
File sizes/loading speed is not optimized, will work on it later.
